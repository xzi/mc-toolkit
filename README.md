This repo is a collection of links to things I use in order to make Minecraft more fun to play.

## Launcher

<b>Wait, why are we using a custom launcher?</b>  
Simply put, the default Minecraft launcher lacks a TON of features that make it really annoying to use. Things such as all versions share the same .minecraft folder, no way to quickly swap out mods for different versions, and it just doesn't look all that nice. Prism fixes those issues while providing quality of life things that should have been in the default launcher. It's still kind of rough around the edges but it works perfectly fine for mine and most people's purpose.

<b>Important Note:</b> Prism Launcher doesn't come with Java for security reasons. You will have to download a copy yourself. You can find the instructions to that [here](https://prismlauncher.org/wiki/getting-started/installing-java/).
