# Rucker's Minecraft Toolkit
<h3 align="center"><b>MASSIVELY WIP!!!</h3></b>  

This repo is a collection of links to things I use in order to make Minecraft more fun to play.  
  
<b>Note: I have not and do not claim to have made anything linked in this list other than the list itself. All rights and credits belong to their respective authors and creators.</b>  

--------------------
## Launcher
<h3 align="center">Prism Launcher</h3>  
<p align="center"><a href="https://github.com/PrismLauncher/PrismLauncher/releases/latest" target="_blank">Download Here</a></p>  
  
<p align="center"><b>Wait, why are we using a custom launcher?</b>  
Simply put, the default Minecraft launcher lacks a TON of features that make it really annoying to use. Things such as all versions share the same .minecraft folder, no way to quickly swap out mods for different versions, and it just doesn't look all that nice. Prism fixes those issues while providing quality of life things that should have been in the default launcher. It's still kind of rough around the edges but it works perfectly fine for mine and most people's purpose.

<p align="center"><b>Important Note:</b> Prism Launcher doesn't come with Java for security reasons. You will have to download a copy yourself. You can find the instructions to that <a href="https://prismlauncher.org/wiki/getting-started/installing-java/" target="_blank">here</a>.

## Modpacks
<h3 align="center">Fabulously Optimized</h3>  
<p align="center"><a href="https://modrinth.com/modpack/fabulously-optimized" target="_blank">Modrinth</a> / <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/fabulously-optimized" target="_blank">Curseforge</a> / <a href="https://fabulously-optimized.gitbook.io/modpack/" target="_blank">Website</a></p>  
<p align="center">Fabulously Optimized is an optimization modpack for various versions of Minecraft which focuses on improving game performance without changing how the game actually plays. It supports most things Optifine does and you should have no issues getting accustomed to using it.  
  
<h3 align="center">Skyclient</h3> 
<p align="center"><a href="https://skyclient.co/" target="_blank">Website</a> / <a href="https://microcontrollersdev.github.io/Alternatives/launcher/prism_win/#step-4-creating-an-instance" target="_blank">Setup Guide (using Prism)</a>
<p align="center">Skyclient is a customizable modpack for 1.8.9 focused around Hypixel Skyblock. I <b>HIGHLY</b> recommend you read the setup guide above since Prism setup is a bit wonky.

<p align="center">These are the two primary modpacks I use. One for modern survival and another for <s>grind hell</s> Skyblock. If you do not play Hypixel Skyblock then Skyclient isn't needed. I HIGHLY recommend Fabulously Optimized no matter what you are doing on Minecraft since it makes the game so much more playable.

## Resource Packs
<h3 align="center">Faithful</h3>  
<p align="center"><a href="https://faithfulpack.net/" target="_blank">Website</a> / <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/faithful-32x" target="_blank">Curseforge</a> / <a href="https://faithfulpack.net/addons/DotCrosshair" target="_blank">Dot Crosshair</a>
<p align="center">Faithful needs no introduction. It's a phenomenal resource pack that was recently revived and I highly recommend using it if you want Minecraft but in a slightly higher resolution. There is a very popular addons section on the website if you are interested in different textures for certain things.  

<h3 align="center">F8thful</h3>
<p align="center"><a href="https://ewanhowell.com/resourcepacks/f8thful/" target="_blank">Website</a> / <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/f8thful" target="_blank">Curseforge</a>
<p align="center">It's Minecraft, except lower res. I love 8x8 packs so I have this installed and occasionally use it.
